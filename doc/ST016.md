19. **3.2 API详细设计Agent (API Detailed Design Agent):**

My primary task is to design detailed APIs if the sub-task involves them, specifically focusing on external interfaces like REST APIs (URL paths, HTTP methods, request/response schemas, etc.).

After carefully reviewing the `SubTaskContextPackage_ST016_v1.0`, particularly:
*   **`sub_task_description`**: "Implement the Project_Knowledge_Base_Manager_Service (PKBM_Service) core logic for file operations."
*   **`architecture_context.core_responsibilities_for_this_subtask`**: Focuses on internal logic for CRUD, directory/naming enforcement, serialized access, and retrieval logic.
*   **`architecture_context.relevant_interfaces_overview`**: Critically states, "This core logic will underpin interfaces like `store_artifact` (ST017) and `retrieve_artifact` (ST017) which will be defined in detail later." and "The PKBM_Service will be called internally by other Python services/agents, primarily the Agent_Orchestration_Service."
*   The `HighLevelArchitectureDesignDocument_v1.0` also indicates that the `PKBM_Service` is accessed via "Internal Call CID009, CID010" from the `Agent_Orchestration_Service`.

It is clear that **sub-task ST016 itself does not involve the creation or design of new external HTTP APIs.** This sub-task is focused on implementing the foundational Python classes and functions that constitute the *internal core logic* of the `PKBM_Service`. The actual Python methods that will serve as the callable interfaces for other internal services (like `store_artifact`, `retrieve_artifact`) are part of sub-task ST017 and their detailed *Python-level* design (class methods, parameters, return types) will be handled by the "3.4 类与函数逻辑设计Agent" when processing ST016 and ST017.

Given that there are no external APIs (HTTP-based or similar) to be designed for ST016, I will produce a document indicating this. The "API" in the context of ST016 refers to the internal programming interface (i.e., Python class/method signatures), which is not the purview of *this* specific agent (3.2 API Detailed Design Agent for *external* APIs).

Therefore, the API detailed design for ST016 is "Not Applicable."

Here is the formal output:

  "reasoning": "Sub-task ST016 focuses on implementing the internal core logic for file operations within the Project_Knowledge_Base_Manager_Service (PKBM_Service).

The detailed design of these internal Python methods falls under the responsibility of the '3.4 类与函数逻辑设计Agent'.",

24. **3.7 详细设计汇总与指令生成Agent (Detailed Design Aggregation & Instruction Generator Agent):**

## 《代码实现指导书》(Implementation Guide) for Sub-task ST016

**Document ID:** ImplementationGuide_ST016_v1.0
**Version:** 1.0
**Timestamp:** (Will be set by PKBM upon storage)
**Generated By:** 3.7 Detailed Design Aggregation & Instruction Generator Agent
**Sub-task ID:** ST016
**Sub-task Description:** Implement the Project_Knowledge_Base_Manager_Service (PKBM_Service) core logic for file operations.

**Based On Documents:**
*   SubTaskContextPackage_ST016_v1.0
*   APIDetailedDesign_ST016_v1.0
*   DataModelDetailedDesign_ST016_v1.0
*   ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0
*   FileStructurePlan_ST016_v1.0
*   SecurityConsiderations_ST016_v1.0

### 1. Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the core logic of the `Project_Knowledge_Base_Manager_Service` (PKBM_Service). This service is responsible for all file-based artifact storage and retrieval operations within the "多Agent软件开发自动化系统". The implementation must strictly adhere to the provided designs, project coding standards, and the overarching principle of prioritizing functionality and simplicity over security hardening.

### 2. General Implementation Notes

*   **Programming Language:** Python (as per `ProjectMetadata_v1.0`).
*   **No Security Implementation:** As per `SecurityConsiderations_ST016_v1.0` and `SubTaskContextPackage_ST016_v1.0`, all security considerations (input validation for security, authN/Z, secret management) are **explicitly excluded**. Assume a perfectly secure operating environment. The focus is on functional robustness and correctness.
*   **Coding Standards:** Strict adherence to the project's coding standards (provided in `SubTaskContextPackage_ST016_v1.0`) is mandatory. Key points include:
    *   Modular design (single responsibility).
    *   Configuration via Python dataclasses (no external config files, no hardcoding).
    *   Comprehensive error handling (try-except, clear messages, avoid crashes).
    *   Detailed logging (independent files, multi-level, trace info).
    *   Code style (4-space indent, 79-char line limit, CamelCase for classes, snake_case for functions/variables, descriptive names).
    *   Type Hinting: Mandatory for all function parameters and return values.
    *   **Crucially: NO COMMENTS OR DOCSTRINGS. Code must be self-explanatory.**
*   **Path Handling:** Use `pathlib.Path` for all file system path manipulations.
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement error handling and logging as specified in `ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0` for each method.
*   **Concurrency:** The `_write_lock` (`threading.Lock`) must be used to serialize all filesystem write operations as designed.

### 3. File and Directory Structure

The following files need to be created as per `FileStructurePlan_ST016_v1.0`. All paths are relative to the assumed project source root `multi_agent_dev_system/`.

### 4. File Implementation Details

#### 4.1. File: `multi_agent_dev_system/pkbm_service/models.py`

*   **Purpose:** Defines the data model classes (`PKBMConfig`, `ArtifactMetadata`) for the PKBM_Service.
*   **Required Imports:**
    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass, field
    from pathlib import Path
    from typing import Dict, Optional, Any # Any is for pkbm_config_ref in ArtifactMetadata to avoid circular import if PKBMConfig is defined later in the same file or for type hinting simplicity here.
    import datetime
    ```
*   **Content to Implement:**
    *   **Class `PKBMConfig`**:
        *   Implement this Python dataclass exactly as defined in `DataModelDetailedDesign_ST016_v1.0`, section "2. PKBM Configuration Data Model".
        *   Ensure all fields, types, default values, and semantic anchors (as comments in the design, but not in the final code) are accurately represented.
    *   **Class `ArtifactMetadata`**:
        *   Implement this Python dataclass exactly as defined in `DataModelDetailedDesign_ST016_v1.0`, section "3. Artifact Metadata Model".
        *   Ensure all fields, types, the `@property` for `full_path` and `directory_path`, and their logic are accurately implemented.
        *   The `pkbm_config_ref` field is critical for path calculations.

            *   Logic: As per `ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0`, `PKBMService_ListArtifacts`. Determine `search_root`. Compile regex patterns. Use `search_root.rglob('*')`. For each file, call `_parse_filename_to_metadata`. Apply filters (base_name, tag, agent_id). If `content_keyword` and `default_file_extension` (.txt), read content and search case-insensitively. Append matches to list. Log. Handle exceptions.

#### 4.3. File: `multi_agent_dev_system/pkbm_service/__init__.py`

*   **Purpose:** Makes `pkbm_service` a Python package and exposes key classes for easy import.
*   **Required Imports (within this `__init__.py`):**
    ```python
    from .models import PKBMConfig, ArtifactMetadata
    from .service import PKBMService
    ```
*   **Content to Implement:**
    *   The import statements above.
    *   Optionally, an `__all__` list if desired for explicit public API definition:
        ```python
        __all__ = ['PKBMConfig', 'ArtifactMetadata', 'PKBMService']
        ```

### 5. Security Checkpoints Review

As per `SecurityConsiderations_ST016_v1.0`:
*   **ST016-CP001 (Robustness of File Ops):** Ensure all methods in `PKBMService` handle file system exceptions gracefully, log them, and re-raise. The `_write_lock` must be used.
*   **ST016-CP002 (Adherence to Conventions):** The implementation of `_parse_filename_to_metadata` and the path construction logic within `ArtifactMetadata` and `PKBMService` must strictly follow the defined naming/directory conventions.
*   **ST016-CP003 (PKBMConfig Usage):** Ensure `metadata.pkbm_config_ref` is always validated and used correctly.
*   **ST016-CP004 (No Security-Specific Input Validation):** Confirm no security-specific validation is added.

This guide, when followed, should result in an implementation that meets all functional requirements for ST016 according to the detailed designs.

Now, I will generate the **精确指令文本 (Prompt)** for the "Roo code LLM".

```text
You are an expert Python developer tasked with implementing core components for a "多Agent软件开发自动化系统".
Your goal is to generate three Python files as specified below.
The project operates in an **ABSOLUTELY SECURE ENVIRONMENT**. Therefore, ALL security considerations, including input validation for security, authentication, authorization, or secret management, MUST BE COMPLETELY IGNORED. Prioritize functionality, success rate, and simplicity of use.
No user interaction or CLI components are involved in this sub-task.

**CRITICAL CODING STANDARDS TO FOLLOW FOR ALL GENERATED FILES:**

1.  **MODULAR DESIGN:**
    *   Each class or module should focus on a single functionality (high cohesion, low coupling).
    *   Utilize Python's advanced features (decorators, classes, context managers) where appropriate.
    *   Modules should interact through clearly defined and stable interfaces.
    *   Use Dependency Injection principles where applicable (e.g., passing config objects).

2.  **CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:**
    *   All configuration items MUST be managed via Python dataclasses.
    *   All configuration items should be centrally defined.
    *   NO HARDCODING of configuration values.
    *   NO EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION FILES (JSON, YAML, etc.).
    *   Configuration item names should be descriptive.

3.  **ERROR HANDLING:**
    *   Use try-except blocks to comprehensively capture and properly handle all possible exceptions.
    *   Exception messages MUST include clear, accurate problem descriptions and use formatted output.
    *   Ensure the program can gracefully handle or safely propagate exceptions, avoiding crashes.

4.  **LOGGING:**
    *   Use the standard Python `logging` module.
    *   Log to independent log files (configuration of handlers is outside this scope, but assume a logger is provided or can be obtained via `logging.getLogger()`).
    *   Use different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
    *   Each log message should include timestamp, module name, log level, function name, line number, and trace information (achieved via logger configuration, but code should provide meaningful messages).
    *   Record execution times of key operations if specified in the design.

5.  **CODE STYLE:**
    *   Indentation: 4 spaces.
    *   Line Length: Max 79 characters.
    *   Naming Conventions:
        *   Class names: `CamelCase`.
        *   Function, variable, method names: `snake_case`.
        *   Constant names: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
        *   All names MUST be descriptive.
    *   Type Hints: MANDATORY for ALL function/method parameters and return values. Use the `typing` module.

6.  **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:**
    *   Prioritize Python standard library.
    *   Minimize external (non-Python library) dependencies.

7.  **CODE REUSE:**
    *   Abstract repetitive logic into functions/methods.
    *   Ensure generality and encapsulation.

8.  **ABSOLUTELY NO COMMENTS OR DOCSTRINGS:**
    *   The code MUST be self-explanatory through clear naming, structure, and type hints.
    *   DO NOT ADD ANY `# comments` or `"""Docstrings"""` to the Python code.
