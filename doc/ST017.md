# Code Implementation Guide for Sub-task ST017

**Document ID:** CodeImplementationGuide_ST017_v1.0
**Version:** 1.0
**Timestamp:** CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
**Generated By:** 3.7 Detailed Design Aggregation & Instruction Generator Agent
**Sub-task ID:** ST017
**Sub-task Description:** Implement the `store_artifact` and `retrieve_artifact_content` interfaces in PKBM_Service.

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the `store_artifact` and `retrieve_artifact_content` public methods within the `PKBMService` class. This implementation is part of sub-task ST017. The `PKBMService` class itself, along with its core structure, constructor, private helper methods, and other public methods (like `find_artifact_paths`), was designed and its initial implementation prompt was generated under sub-task ST016.

## 2. Sub-task Overview

The objective of ST017 is to complete the functionality of the `PKBMService` by providing robust implementations for:
*   **`store_artifact`**: Storing artifacts (files) into the file-based Project Knowledge Base, adhering to defined directory structures, naming conventions, versioning, and serialized write access.
*   **`retrieve_artifact_content`**: Retrieving the content of a specific artifact given its full path.

These methods are critical for the PKBM to function as the central repository for all project-related information.

## 3. Key Design References

The implementation of ST017 must strictly adhere to the designs and contexts provided in the following documents:

1.  **`CP_ST017_v1.0` (Context Package for ST017):**
    *   Provides the overall context for this sub-task, including references to all other relevant design documents and critical user-defined coding standards (especially the security override and no comments/docstrings directives).
2.  **`ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0`:**
    *   **This is the primary design document for the *logic* of the `store_artifact` and `retrieve_artifact_content` methods.** It details their parameters, return types, step-by-step core logic, error handling procedures, and the custom exceptions they should raise. It also defines the private helper methods (e.g., `_get_category_path`, `_generate_filename`, `_generate_timestamp`) and custom exceptions that these public methods will utilize.
3.  **`ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST017_v1.0`:**
    *   Confirms the scope of ST017 as implementing these two specific methods within the existing `PKBMService` class structure, referencing `ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0` for the detailed logic.
4.  **`DataModelDetailedDesign_ST016_v1.0`:**
    *   Defines the PKBM's file system organization, including the concept of `pkbm_root_directory`, `primary_categories`, directory structure conventions, and file naming conventions. The `store_artifact` method must ensure all created files and paths conform to this model.
5.  **`FileStructurePlan_ST016_v1.0`:**
    *   Specifies the target file for modification: `MAS_Simplified_Project/mas_core/services/pkbm_service.py`.
6.  **`SecurityConsiderations_ST017_v1.0` (and `SecurityConsiderations_ST016_v1.0`):**
    *   Reiterates the project's directive for an "absolutely secure environment" and the deprioritization of security-specific hardening measures. The robustness checks identified (e.g., path validation against `root_dir`, category validation) are part of the functional design from ST016 and should be implemented as such for correctness and operational stability.

## 4. Implementation Details

The following methods need to be implemented within the `PKBMService` class located in `MAS_Simplified_Project/mas_core/services/pkbm_service.py`.

### 4.1. Method: `store_artifact`

*   **Objective:** To store an artifact in the PKBM.
*   **Signature (from `ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0`):**
    ```python
    def store_artifact(self, category_name: str, artifact_identifier: str, source_agent_id: str, content: Union[str, bytes], file_extension_override: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    ```
*   **Core Logic:**
    *   The implementation must follow the detailed step-by-step logic provided in `ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0` for the `store_artifact` method. This includes:
        1.  Logging setup.
        2.  Validating `category_name` using `self._get_category_path()`.
        3.  Determining the correct file extension (handling `file_extension_override`, inferring from `artifact_identifier` for `.json`/`.md`, or defaulting to `.txt`).
        4.  Generating `timestamp_version` using `self._generate_timestamp()`.
        5.  Generating `filename` using `self._generate_filename()`.
        6.  Constructing the `full_path`.
        7.  Acquiring and releasing `self.write_lock` correctly to ensure serialized writes.
        8.  Creating the target directory if it doesn't exist (`os.makedirs(target_dir, exist_ok=True)`).
        9.  Opening the file in the correct mode (`'wb'` for bytes, `'w'` with `utf-8` encoding for str).
        10. Writing the content.
        11. Handling `OSError` by raising `PKBMStorageError`.
        12. Handling lock acquisition failure by raising `PKBMConcurrencyError`.
        13. Returning the `full_path` of the stored artifact.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   Utilize all relevant private helper methods designed in ST016 (`_get_category_path`, `_generate_timestamp`, `_generate_filename`).
    *   Strictly adhere to error handling and custom exception usage as defined.

### 4.2. Method: `retrieve_artifact_content`

*   **Objective:** To retrieve the content of a specific artifact from the PKBM.
*   **Signature (from `ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0`):**
    ```python
    def retrieve_artifact_content(self, full_artifact_path: str, as_bytes: bool = False) -> Union[str, bytes, None]:
    ```
*   **Core Logic:**
    *   The implementation must follow the detailed step-by-step logic provided in `ClassFunctionLogicDesign_ST016_v1.0` for the `retrieve_artifact_content` method. This includes:
        1.  Logging setup.
        2.  Validating that `full_artifact_path` is within the `self.root_dir` (using `os.path.abspath(self.root_dir)` for comparison). Raise `PKBMRetrievalError` if validation fails.
        3.  Opening the file in the correct mode (`'rb'` if `as_bytes` is True, `'r'` with `utf-8` encoding otherwise).
        4.  Reading the content.
        5.  Returning the content.
        6.  Handling `FileNotFoundError` by logging a warning and returning `None`.
        7.  Handling `OSError` by logging and raising `PKBMRetrievalError`.
        8.  Handling `UnicodeDecodeError` (if not `as_bytes`) by logging and raising `PKBMRetrievalError`.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   The path validation is a robustness measure for correct operation within the PKBM's designated scope.
    *   Strictly adhere to error handling and custom exception usage as defined.

## 5. Coding Standards and Constraints

All implementation work must strictly adhere to the user-defined coding standards provided in `CP_ST017_v1.0 (context_data.project_metadata_context.user_defined_coding_standards)`. Key points to re-emphasize:

*   **ABSOLUTELY NO SECURITY FEATURES:** The system operates in an absolutely secure environment. Prioritize functional success and simplicity. Do NOT implement any security measures beyond the basic robustness checks already designed (e.g., path validation within root).
*   **NO COMMENTS OR DOCSTRINGS:** The code must NOT contain any comments or docstrings.
*   **Type Hints:** Mandatory for all function/method parameters and return values.
*   **Logging:** Comprehensive logging using the `logging` module as per standards.
*   **Error Handling:** Use try-except for all I/O and potential errors; raise defined custom exceptions.
*   **Naming Conventions:** `ClassName` (CamelCase), `function_name`/`variable_name`/`method_name` (snake_case), `CONSTANT_NAME` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE).
*   **Line Length:** Max 79 characters.
*   **Indentation:** 4 spaces.

## 6. File to Modify

*   `MAS_Simplified_Project/mas_core/services/pkbm_service.py`

## 7. Expected Outcome

Upon completion of ST017, the `store_artifact` and `retrieve_artifact_content` methods in the `PKBMService` class within `pkbm_service.py` will be fully implemented, functional, and compliant with all specified designs and coding standards. The `PKBMService` will then be capable of its primary storage and retrieval operations.

This will be stored in PKBM as **`LLMPrompt_ST017_v1.0.txt`**.

```text
You are an expert Python programmer tasked with completing the implementation of two public methods, `store_artifact` and `retrieve_artifact_content`, within an existing `PKBMService` class. This class is designed for managing a file-based Project Knowledge Base.

**CRITICAL OVERRIDING DIRECTIVES (Non-negotiable):**
1.  **ABSOLUTELY NO SECURITY FEATURES:** The system will operate in an absolutely secure environment. All permissions are assumed to be fully open. Your absolute priorities are functional success, code simplicity, and ease of use/configuration. You MUST NOT implement any security measures (e.g., complex input sanitization beyond basic filesystem compatibility requirements already handled by OS, file permission settings like `os.chmod`, encryption, resource quotas) that could add complexity or cause operational failures. The robustness checks mentioned later are part of the functional design for correctness, not security hardening.
2.  **NO COMMENTS OR DOCSTRINGS:** The generated code must NOT contain any comments or docstrings.
3.  **STRICT ADHERENCE TO CODING STANDARDS (MANDATORY):**
    *   **Modular Design:** Single responsibility for the class.
    *   **Configuration Management:** No hardcoding. Configuration (root directory, categories) is injected via constructor. NO EXTERNAL CONFIG FILES.
    *   **Error Handling:** Use try-except for all I/O and potential errors. Raise custom exceptions as defined. Exception messages must be clear, formatted, and highlight key info for debugging.
    *   **Logging:** Use the `logging` module. Logs MUST include timestamp, module name, level, function name, line number, and relevant trace info (e.g., `exc_info=True` for errors). Log execution time for key operations if easily applicable.
    *   **Code Style:** 4-space indent. Max 79 chars per line. ClassName: `CamelCase`. function_name, variable_name, method_name: `snake_case`. CONSTANT_NAME: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. All names must be descriptive.
    *   **Type Hints:** MANDATORY for all function/method parameters and return values. Use `typing` module (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`, `Union`, `Any`).
    *   **Dependencies:** Prefer Python standard library.
    *   **Code Reuse:** Utilize existing private helper methods within the class.

**TASK: Implement the `store_artifact` and `retrieve_artifact_content` methods in the `PKBMService` class.**

**DETAILED LOGIC FOR `store_artifact` (Implement this logic):**
1.  Initialize logger: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Record start time for performance tracking.
2.  Get `target_dir` by calling `self._get_category_path(category_name)`. This call itself handles `InvalidCategoryError`.
3.  Determine `determined_extension`:
    *   If `file_extension_override` is provided, use `file_extension_override.lstrip('.')`.
    *   Else if `artifact_identifier.lower().endswith('.json')`, `determined_extension = 'json'`.
    *   Else if `artifact_identifier.lower().endswith('.md')`, `determined_extension = 'md'`.
    *   Else, `determined_extension = 'txt'`.
4.  Generate `timestamp_version = self._generate_timestamp()`.
5.  Generate `filename = self._generate_filename(artifact_identifier, source_agent_id, timestamp_version, determined_extension)`.
6.  Construct `full_path = os.path.join(target_dir, filename)`.
7.  Acquire lock: `lock_acquired = self.write_lock.acquire(timeout=10)`.
8.  If not `lock_acquired`:
    *   `logger.error("PKBMConcurrencyError: Failed to acquire write lock for storing artifact.")`.
    *   Raise `PKBMConcurrencyError("Failed to acquire write lock for storing artifact.")`.
9.  `try:` block:
    *   `os.makedirs(target_dir, exist_ok=True)` (Safety check, though `_initialize_pkbm_structure` should handle it).
    *   If `isinstance(content, bytes)`: `mode = 'wb'`, `encoding_param = None`.
    *   Else (content is str): `mode = 'w'`, `encoding_param = 'utf-8'`.
    *   `with open(full_path, mode, encoding=encoding_param) as f:`
        *   `f.write(content)`.
    *   Record end time. Calculate duration. `logger.info(f"Artifact stored successfully: {full_path}. Duration: {duration_ms:.2f} ms")`.
    *   Return `full_path`.
10. `except OSError as e:` block:
    *   `logger.error(f"OSError storing artifact {full_path}: {e}", exc_info=True)`.
    *   Raise `PKBMStorageError(f"Failed to store artifact {full_path}: {e}")`.
11. `finally:` block:
    *   If `lock_acquired`, `self.write_lock.release()`.

**DETAILED LOGIC FOR `retrieve_artifact_content` (Implement this logic):**
1.  Initialize logger: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Record start time.
2.  Path validation: `abs_root_dir = os.path.abspath(self.root_dir)`. `abs_artifact_path = os.path.abspath(full_artifact_path)`.
3.  If not `abs_artifact_path.startswith(abs_root_dir)`:
    *   `logger.error(f"PKBMRetrievalError: Attempt to access path '{full_artifact_path}' outside of PKBM root '{self.root_dir}'.")`.
    *   Raise `PKBMRetrievalError(f"Attempt to access path '{full_artifact_path}' outside of PKBM root.")`.
4.  `try:` block:
    *   If `as_bytes`: `mode = 'rb'`, `encoding_param = None`.
    *   Else: `mode = 'r'`, `encoding_param = 'utf-8'`.
    *   `with open(full_artifact_path, mode, encoding=encoding_param) as f:`
        *   `content_data = f.read()`.
    *   Record end time. Calculate duration. `logger.info(f"Artifact content retrieved: {full_artifact_path}. Duration: {duration_ms:.2f} ms")`.
    *   Return `content_data`.
5.  `except FileNotFoundError:` block:
    *   `logger.warning(f"Artifact not found: {full_artifact_path}")`.
    *   Return `None`.
6.  `except OSError as e:` block:
    *   `logger.error(f"OSError retrieving artifact {full_artifact_path}: {e}", exc_info=True)`.
    *   Raise `PKBMRetrievalError(f"Failed to retrieve artifact {full_artifact_path} due to OS error: {e}")`.
7.  `except UnicodeDecodeError as e:` block (only if not `as_bytes`):
    *   `logger.error(f"UnicodeDecodeError retrieving artifact {full_artifact_path} as text: {e}", exc_info=True)`.
    *   Raise `PKBMRetrievalError(f"Failed to decode artifact {full_artifact_path} as text: {e}")`.


**DATA MODEL / NAMING CONVENTIONS (Context for implementation):**
*   PKBM Root Directory: Configurable, passed to constructor.
*   Directory Structure: `[pkbm_root_directory]/[primary_category_name]/[filename]`
*   Filename Format: `[artifact_identifier]-[source_agent_id_tag]-[timestamp_version].[file_extension]`
    *   `artifact_identifier`: e.g., '原始用户需求_v1.0'
    *   `source_agent_id_tag`: e.g., 'Agent0.1' (format `AgentX.Y`)
    *   `timestamp_version`: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm` (e.g., from `_generate_timestamp`)
    *   `file_extension`: e.g., 'txt', 'json', 'md'

**ROBUSTNESS CHECKPOINTS (Implement as part of functional logic, no extra security layers):**
*   **ST017_ROBUST_CP01 (store_artifact):** Correctly use `_get_category_path` for target directory.
*   **ST017_ROBUST_CP02 (retrieve_artifact_content):** Correctly implement path validation against `self.root_dir`.
*   **ST017_ROBUST_CP03 (store_artifact):** Correctly use `self.write_lock`.
*   **ST017_ROBUST_CP04 (both methods):** Implement comprehensive I/O error handling using try-except and custom exceptions with detailed logging.
*   **ST017_ROBUST_CP05 (store_artifact):** Correctly implement file extension determination logic.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
The `MAS_Simplified_Project/mas_core/services/pkbm_service.py` file with the `store_artifact` and `retrieve_artifact_content` methods fully implemented according to the detailed logic provided above, adhering to all specified constraints and coding standards. The rest of the class structure (imports, exceptions, `__init__`, private methods, `find_artifact_paths`) should remain as provided in the context.
